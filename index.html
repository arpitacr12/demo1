        Abdul Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO), right after graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960. As a young scientist, he was assigned his first project to design and develop a hovercraft for the country’s defence applications. A hovercraft is an amphibious craft capable of travelling over land, water, mud, ice and other surfaces. After days of hard-work, Kalam and his team were successful in developing India’s first indigenous hovercraft which was named Nandi, the impressive white bull who acts as the vehicle of the Hindu deity Lord Shiva. Project Nandi received massive applause from the then Defense Minister, V.K Krishna Menon, and encouraged Kalam for his future endeavours. However, Project Nandi was shelved as the new government in power didn’t show any interest in the invention.

Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). In 1969 he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India. Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles, which helped earn him the nickname “Missile Man.” Among those successes was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.
rom 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as principal scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister. His prominent role in the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as a national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the international community. In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a road map for transforming India from a less-developed to a developed society in 20 years. The plan called for, among other measures, increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology as a vehicle for economic growth, and widening access to health care .
